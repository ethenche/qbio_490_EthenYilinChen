Due Date: Thursday 9/19 @ 11:59 PM
Answer the following questions about Bash:
● Type out definitions for the following commands and shortcuts in your own words. Refer to the slides for definitions of commands, and use google to look up the definitions of any unknown shortcuts.
a. pwd: Print working directory - it prints out the current directory you are in
b. mkdir: Make directory - It makes a new directory for you
c. cd <dir>: Change directory - it moves you into another directory, either absolute or relative paths are allowed, cd without input will lead you to the home directory
d. cd..: Takes you one directory up from your cuurent directory
e. ls: list - list all the contents in your current directory
f. rm and the -r flag: remove - deletes that file for rm itself, but rm -r deletes that directory, there is no undo button
g. cat: concatenate - There are several ways of using cat as I searched on the internet, but it is mainly used to concatenate and display the contents of files.
h. head: It displays the first 10 lines of a file
i. tail: It displays the last 10 lines of a file
j. scp: Secure Copy - it copies a file to another location. It can copy directory as well when used as "scp -r"
k. nano (including Ctrl+o and Ctrl+x)：nano example.txt would open this example.txt file, if it does not exist yet, nano will create a new file called example.txt. Ctrl+o is the save change command,
Ctrl + x is the exit command.
l. --help: a command followed by --help provides users with information about how to use the command, including its syntax, available options, and sometimes examples of usage.
m. TAB: TAB can be used to autocomplete usernames, directory, file names, or even command options when there is only one username/directory/file/command that start with the input. If there are multiple
autocomplete options, it will list you all the eligible choices. 
n. Ctrl+a: Move to the beggining of the line
o. Ctrl+e: Move to the end of the line
p. Ctrl+r: Reverse Search
q. Ctrl+k: Cut to the end of the line from where the cursor is at
r. Ctrl+u: Cut to the beginning of the line from where the cursor is at
s. Ctrl+l: Clear the current  terminal screen
